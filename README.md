dotfiles
========

My configuration files for unix-like places of worship.

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jvarsoke/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

#then link everything manually -- for now

```

## What to expect
In short, not much.  This is a first forray into organization of something built up over years of unixing.
