dotfiles
========

My configuration files for unix-like places of worship.

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jvarsoke/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

#then link everything manually -- for now

```

## What to expect
In short, not much.  This is a first forray into organization of something built up over years of unixing.

## TODO
List of requirements I'd like this to fulfill
	- Bootstrap should create all symlinks
	- All symlinks are to $HOME
	- Files symed to $HOME might be in sub-dirs for organization
	- All symed files get a .dot in front
	- Do directories?
	  .vim does
	  bin does not
	- bashrc should be split into init.d type runfiles
	- Should they go in subject-related directories?
	- If so, the would be slower to read (find)
